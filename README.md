## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Raj Rishav — a recent MS in Business Analytics graduate 2025, from Arizona State University with 4 years of experience in data analytics and business intelligence, turning data into actionable insights. I enjoy solving business problems through SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and ETL pipelines, especially in supply chain, healthcare, and operations analytics.


## 🔹 What I do best

Build interactive dashboards (Tableau / Power BI) that make complex data easy to understand

Design and optimize ETL workflows to ensure clean, reliable data

Apply analytics & ML techniques (forecasting, clustering, optimization) to drive decisions

Communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## 🔹 Projects:

Inventory Optimization – HonorHealth Medical Group (Capstone) : Built Python ETL + Tableau dashboards that reduced surgical implant overstock by 8–10%

AI Powered Fitness Equipment Monitoring – Arizona State University : YOLOv8n-Pose based platform to detect gym equipment occupancy in real-time

Customer Purchase Pattern Analysis: SQL cohort analysis to identify repeat buyer trends and improve retention strategies
